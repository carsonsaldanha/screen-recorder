# screen-recorder
A free and private screen recording web app.

To run this project locally, you'll need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (which comes bundled with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), a JavaScript package manager). [Here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04) is a short little guide on how to install it if you are unfamiliar (works on Chrome OS).

Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.

Next, run `npm start` in the project directory and open http://localhost:8080 to view the web app.

To generate production-ready assets, run `npm run build`. This will produce bundle.js and bundle.css.
